functionality to distribute posts in connection groups organized via Wordpress Taxonomies

## Requirements

* PHP 5.6+
* [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) 4.7+
* Distributor plug-in (recommended with [Distributor fork](https://github.com/NovemBit/distributor))

## Install

At this moment, Distributor Groups Taxonomy add-on is not yet compatible with original [Distributor](https://github.com/10up/distributor), therefore, please use our  [Distributor fork](https://github.com/NovemBit/distributor).

Once you have Distributor installed, [download the latest master build](https://github.com/NovemBit/distributor-groups-taxonomy-addon/archive/master.zip) and install on your website.

## Plugin Usage

You just need to have Distributor Groups Taxonomy add-on installed on both sides, no additional configuration needed. Please note that this add-on was tested for single-site installation with external connections.
